Name of article: A Genetic Analysis of Taoyuan Pig and Its Phylogenetic Relationship to Eurasian Pig Breeds

The Taoyaun pig is a native Taiwan breed that was introduced around 1877.  It is believed that many of Taiwanâ€™s pig breeds arrived with human migration from mainland China to Taiwan
In this study, mitochondrial DNA sequences of the D-loop region are used to evaluate the maternal lineage and genetic diversity between the Taoyuan pig and other Lower Changjiang River Basin and Central China Type pig breeds. Samples from 29 different pig breeds will be used.

The genotype data comes from NCBI genbank and used refernce mtDNA for the D-loop region. The links to the sequence regions were provided in the article. I collected all of the reads from each of the 29 breeds and entered them into a text file named Pigs_phylo_raw_data.fasfa 

This textfile then got entered into ClustalW and got aligned, and the aligned data can be found under the file pigs_phylo_raw_dataaligned.fasta
